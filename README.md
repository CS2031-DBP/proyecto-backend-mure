## Prerequisites üîß
___
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Java**: Recommended version 17 or higher
- **PostgreSQL**: Recommended latest version 16
- **Docker**: Latest version
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Latest version

## Getting Started üöÄ
___

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and clone the repository using the following command:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CS2031-DBP/proyecto-backend-mure
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd proyecto-backend-mure
   ```

3. **Open the Project in Your Preferred IDE**

   Preferably use IntelliJ IDEA for this project. Launch IntelliJ IDEA, click on "Open", and select the project directory you just cloned.

4. **Run the Application**

   Run the `MureApplication` class to start the application. IntelliJ will automatically handle the dependencies as specified in the `pom.xml` file since the project uses Maven.

5. **Set Up the Database**

   Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to start the PostgreSQL database using Docker:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

   Here is the Docker configuration for reference:

   ```yaml
   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:latest
       container_name: proyecto-backend-mure-dev
       restart: always
       environment:
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
         POSTGRES_DB: database
       ports:
         - "5433:5432"
   ```

6. **Populate the Database**

   After running the application, execute the `.bat` script located in the `scripts` folder to populate the database.

Following these steps will set up the Mure project on your local machine, allowing you to explore and develop further.
